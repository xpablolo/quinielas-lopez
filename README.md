  Simple project of Data Extraction, Web Scraping and Web Application in Python developed by me.
</p>

## Brief description
Given an Excel document with the weekly predictions of football matches of a group of people, the project automates the process of comparison with the real results extracted from a webpage. The information is shown in a web-app created with Flask and hosted at  <http://pablolo.pythonanywhere.com>.

The project contains hence:
- A Python script [init.py] which reads the Excel document [datos.xlsx] using Pandas and extracts the information needed from <https://www.quiniela15.com/resultados-quiniela> using BeautifulSoup so the predictions can be validated. The scripts creates lastly an Excel document [Resultados.xlsx] with the results of the predictions.
- A Python script [partidos_quiniela.py] which extracts the relevant matches from the same web. This information was not given in the initial Excel document [datos.xlsx].
- A Python document [flask_app.py] for the initialization of the web using Flask.
- The needed html templates for the web grouped in the repository [/templates].
